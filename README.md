Implementation for custom data source instances with encrypted passwords - used for advanced secured configurations for Apache Tomcat

Inspired by reviewing the steps that appears at idesign4all's web site ( http://bit.ly/1aYhhiP )


Development:
Using tomcat-jdbc dependence library for DataSourceFactory API implementation/extension 


Dependences:
tomcat-jdbc.jar (in $TOMCAT_HOME/lib), if you don't have Apache tomcat, download it from ( http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi )


Useful tip:
 When compiling, its better that you must use the tomcat dependency that resides in lib folder of your tomcat installation.
